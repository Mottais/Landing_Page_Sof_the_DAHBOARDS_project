        <h2>About</h2>
        <div class="story">
            <p>Since 2018, I have held the position of methodist for the <a href="https://www.groupe-bam.fr">BAM Group</a>.
                JARNOT is a carpentry and roofing company within the group.</p>
            <p>To date, dashboards already exist in paper format.
                These dashboards were initiated 4 years ago following regular observations that some 'packages' were not ready on time or incomplete.
                These are situations that must be avoided at all costs as they are very costly, especially during the 'installation' steps on site (construction site).</p>
            <p>These dashboards have significantly reduced such issues and improved work organization. The worker must check a step when completed.</p>
            <p>However, this solution has several disadvantages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Paper support does not lend itself well to sharing; several workers may need it at the same time.
                    As a result, the document is not always well updated.</li>
                <li>Information is anonymous, which does not foster accountability among personnel.</li>
                <li>It is a (paper) medium that can be lost or damaged, especially in this sector exposed to weather conditions.</li>
                <li>There is a significant delay in reporting project progress to the supervisor.
                    Often, they have to wait until the end of the day to be informed.
                    This complicates planning and adjustments.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By developing a web application that digitizes the paper document, all these drawbacks are resolved.</p>
